              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Many expired listings in 89117 failed to communicate Summerlin master-planned advantages effectively. Properties positioned generically miss community benefits that define 89117 market value.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                89117's biggest advantage is Summerlin master-planned benefits. Listings that don't highlight community amenities, quality schools, and master-planned advantages miss value that defines 89117 appeal.

                Marketing 89117 as generic Las Vegas misses unique selling points. Buyers specifically choosing 89117 want Summerlin benefits - generic Las Vegas marketing doesn't communicate this effectively.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                89117 resales compete against active Summerlin new construction. Marketing must highlight resale advantages: established neighborhoods, mature landscaping, and proven quality while buyers wait for new builds.
