            The Marketing Problem: 87% Failed Due to Insufficient Exposure
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-3xl">
            Research shows that 87% of expired listings failed because they received only basic MLS exposure. Your home never reached the qualified buyers actively searching through luxury networks, national advertising, and international channels. Regional firms and boutique agencies simply don't have access to the marketing channels that serious buyers use.

            Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices: Institutional Marketing Power
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-3xl">
            Dr. Jan leverages Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices' Fortune 100 marketing power to ensure your home reaches qualified buyers through channels that regional firms can't access.

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Global Brand Recognition</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Berkshire Hathaway is a Fortune 100 company with instant recognition among luxury buyers. When your home carries the BHHS brand, it signals quality and institutional backing that attracts serious buyers.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                International buyers, out-of-state investors, and luxury shoppers recognize Berkshire Hathaway as a trusted brand. This brand power opens doors that regional firms simply can't match.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Your home isn't just another listing - it's a Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices property with institutional marketing behind it.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                BHHS properties receive exposure through TV, radio, and print advertising that reaches buyers across the country. Simply Vegas, Realty ONE, and boutique firms don't have budgets for national advertising.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Your home appears in Wall Street Journal Real Estate, NYT Real Estate sections, and elite luxury portals where serious buyers search. Regional firms can't access these premium channels.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                This isn't just better photos - it's your home appearing where wealthy buyers actually look for properties, not just on local MLS.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
              BHHS has 900+ agents in Nevada alone, plus luxury network connections across all 50 states and international offices. When you list with Dr. Jan, your home is promoted to this entire network.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
              Luxury buyers work with luxury agents who search through BHHS networks. Your home appears in searches by agents who specialize in high-end properties, not just local agents browsing MLS.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Result: Your home gets seen by 10X more qualified buyers with institutional backing. If a buyer in New York wants a Las Vegas property, their BHHS agent finds your listing through the network - something that doesn't happen with regional firms.
