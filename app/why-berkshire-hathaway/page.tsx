            The Truth About Why Your Home Didn't Sell
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-3xl">
            After analyzing hundreds of expired listings, three critical failures emerge: insufficient marketing exposure beyond basic MLS, overpricing by 5-15%, and poor agent communication. Dr. Jan Duffy with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices addresses all three with institutional power that boutique firms simply can't match.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Most expired listings received only basic MLS exposure. Your home never reached the qualified buyers actively searching through luxury networks, national advertising, and international channels.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                The number one killer: agents told you what you wanted to hear about price rather than market reality. Wrong pricing prevented offers even when buyers were interested.

                When your home expired with limited marketing, it wasn't seen by the buyers who were actively looking. Regional firms and boutique agencies simply don't have access to the national advertising, luxury networks, and international channels that Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices provides.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Dr. Jan leverages BHHS institutional marketing power to ensure your home reaches qualified buyers through multiple channels: luxury agent networks, national advertising, premium real estate portals, and international referral partners that regional firms can't access.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                This isn't just better MLS photos - it's institutional marketing power that gets your home in front of 10X more qualified buyers. When buyers are searching through Wall Street Journal Real Estate or BHHS luxury networks, your home appears where competitors' listings don't.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                After 30 years in Las Vegas real estate, Dr. Jan has seen every market cycle. She understands that most agents overprice to win the listing, knowing they'll have to reduce later. This approach wastes your time and money while your home sits on the market.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Dr. Jan uses proprietary BHHS valuation tools combined with her PhD-level analytical approach to determine accurate pricing from day one. She'll have the tough conversation upfront: price your home correctly to sell quickly, or price high and watch it sit.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Her pricing strategy includes real-time adjustments based on showing feedback and market shifts. If initial pricing isn't attracting buyers, she pivots within 14-21 days rather than waiting weeks for the market to catch up.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                The result: homes priced correctly from the start sell faster and for better net proceeds than homes that chase the market downward after being overpriced initially.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                When your previous agent went radio silent, your home stopped moving. Dr. Jan maintains weekly communication with detailed updates: showing feedback, competitor analysis, market shifts, and strategic adjustments needed to keep your listing competitive.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                You'll receive weekly reports showing exactly what's happening: how many showings, buyer feedback themes, competitor listings that sold, and specific recommendations for price or marketing adjustments.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                If your initial strategy isn't working, Dr. Jan pivots within 14-21 days rather than waiting weeks. This proactive approach means your home adapts to market conditions immediately, not after months of silence and stagnation.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                You have 24/7 access at 702-222-1964. Questions about a showing? Call. Concerned about market conditions? Call. Need clarification on strategy? Call. Dr. Jan treats your listing like it's her own investment - because her reputation depends on results, not excuses.

            When you switch to Dr. Jan after an expired listing, here's what changes immediately - a systematic approach that addresses every failure from your previous listing.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
              After Week 4, you'll receive weekly feedback reports with showing analysis, buyer feedback themes, competitor activity, and strategic adjustments. Dr. Jan doesn't "set it and forget it" - she actively manages your listing until it's sold.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Every week brings new data: what's working, what's not, and exactly what needs to change. If price needs adjustment, it happens. If marketing needs enhancement, it happens. If strategy needs pivot, it happens - immediately, not after months of silence.
