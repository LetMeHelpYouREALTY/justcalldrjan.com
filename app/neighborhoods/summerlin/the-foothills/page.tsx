            Understanding The Foothills Summerlin Real Estate Market
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-3xl">
            The Foothills represents Summerlin's elevated communities with stunning mountain views and proximity to Red Rock Canyon. For homeowners whose properties didn't sell, understanding The Foothills' premium positioning is essential for successful relisting.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                The Foothills community offers premium mountain views and elevation that command higher pricing within Summerlin. Properties with Red Rock Canyon views sell at significant premium to comparable homes without views.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Many expired listings in The Foothills failed to showcase view advantages effectively. Properties positioned without highlighting mountain views miss the view premium that defines The Foothills market value.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Dr. Jan helps you showcase The Foothills view advantages: Red Rock Canyon vistas, elevation benefits, and premium pricing that mountain view homes command within Summerlin specifically.

                The Foothills features larger homes, premium amenities, and elevated positioning within Summerlin that attracts luxury buyers seeking mountain view properties with Red Rock proximity.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Your expired listing likely positioned The Foothills homes generically without highlighting upscale community benefits, mountain views, or elevation advantages that define The Foothills market.

            Why The Foothills Homes Don't Sell
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-3xl">
            The Foothills real estate has specific characteristics that can challenge sellers who don't understand this premium sub-community's unique market dynamics.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                The Foothills' biggest value driver is mountain views. Listings that don't showcase Red Rock Canyon vistas and elevation advantages miss the view premium that The Foothills commands.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Marketing The Foothills as generic upscale Summerlin misses unique selling points. Buyers specifically choosing The Foothills want mountain views and elevation - generic luxury marketing doesn't communicate this.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                The Foothills attracts mountain view buyers, nature enthusiasts, and luxury seekers wanting Red Rock proximity. Marketing to generic Summerlin buyers wastes advertising while missing interested buyers.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Your The Foothills home offers advantages other Summerlin areas can't replicate: mountain views, elevation benefits, and upscale community positioning. Generic listings don't communicate these The Foothills-specific benefits effectively.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Dr. Jan's marketing showcases The Foothills advantages with professional photography highlighting Red Rock views, elevation benefits, and luxury amenities that The Foothills buyers specifically appreciate.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              If your The Foothills home didn't sell initially, likely issues included marketing that didn't showcase views, positioning that didn't target luxury buyers, or pricing that didn't reflect The Foothills view premium. Dr. Jan addresses each systematically.
