            Understanding The Trails Summerlin Real Estate Market
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-3xl">
            The Trails represents one of Summerlin's most desirable sub-communities, featuring direct access to the extensive trail system that gives this neighborhood its name. For homeowners whose properties didn't sell, understanding The Trails' unique market positioning is essential for successful relisting.

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Trail Access Premium</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                The Trails community offers direct access to Summerlin's 150+ mile trail system, creating unique value that sets these properties apart. Buyers seeking active lifestyles specifically pay premium for trail-adjacent homes in The Trails.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Many expired listings in The Trails failed to communicate trail access advantages effectively. Properties positioned as generic Summerlin homes miss the trail premium that defines The Trails market value.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Dr. Jan helps you showcase The Trails' trail access advantages: direct trail connectivity, active lifestyle positioning, and premium value that trail-accessible homes command within Summerlin specifically.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                The Trails features mature landscaping, established community amenities, and proven neighborhood quality that newer Summerlin areas haven't developed yet. This established character attracts buyers seeking proven Summerlin investment.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Your expired listing likely competed against newer Summerlin construction without highlighting The Trails' established advantages: mature trees, proven community character, and settled neighborhood atmosphere.

            Why The Trails Homes Don't Sell
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-3xl">
            The Trails real estate has specific characteristics that can challenge sellers who don't understand this sub-community's unique market dynamics within Summerlin.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Missing Trail Premium</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                The Trails' biggest value driver is trail access. Listings that don't highlight direct trail connectivity and active lifestyle advantages miss the premium pricing that The Trails trail access commands.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Generic Summerlin Positioning</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Marketing The Trails as just another Summerlin neighborhood misses unique selling points. Buyers specifically choosing The Trails want trail access - generic Summerlin marketing doesn't communicate this advantage.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-blue-200">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Wrong Buyer Targeting</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                The Trails attracts active lifestyle buyers, nature enthusiasts, and those seeking trail connectivity. Marketing to generic Summerlin buyers who don't value trail access wastes advertising while missing interested buyers.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Your The Trails home offers advantages other Summerlin areas can't replicate: direct trail access, active lifestyle positioning, and established neighborhood character. Generic listings don't communicate these The Trails-specific benefits effectively.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              If your The Trails home didn't sell initially, likely issues included marketing that didn't highlight trail access, positioning that didn't target active lifestyle buyers, or pricing that didn't reflect The Trails trail access premium. Dr. Jan addresses each systematically.
