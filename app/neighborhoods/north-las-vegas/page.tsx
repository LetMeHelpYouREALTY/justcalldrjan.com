            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
              When North Las Vegas homes don't sell, it's often because they're competing against new construction without highlighting comparative advantages. Pricing must reflect value relative to new homes while showcasing what existing homes offer that new construction can't.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
              Presentation becomes crucial since new construction has inherent appeal. Existing homes need professional staging and photography demonstrating move-in ready quality, modern updates, or potential for customization. Marketing must reach buyers actively comparing new vs existing options.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Dr. Jan Duffy's approach understands these dynamics.
